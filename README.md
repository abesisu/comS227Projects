# comS227Projects
hw3_skeleton contains the project of the 2048 clone I programmed in COM S 227 at Iowa State. 
I developed the logic inside the Powers.java and ShiftUtil.java to make the game playable. 
Encapsulation through objects and algorithms were heavily utilized.

hw4_skeleton is the project where I developed the logic and implemented OOP to create a new coding language called "Junebug."
The program utilizes two main abstract parent classes called ExpressionReference.java and InstructionReference.java that handle the
inheritance and code reduction for the operator and instruction classes respectively.

mini3_skeleton is a recursive maze solving program. By running RunSearcher.java, the program shows the recursive progress in action.
I developed the logic. for this program in MazeExplorer.java by using recursion, objects, and encapsulation.
